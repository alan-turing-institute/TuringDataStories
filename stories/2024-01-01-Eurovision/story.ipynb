    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Eurovision Song Contest, or *Eurovision* for short, is an annual competition featuring (mostly) European countries. It is in fact the longest running international televised music competition, having started in 1951 as what was then seen as a technical experiment in transnational live broadcasting. The competition has continued every year since &mdash; except in 2020 when it was cancelled, [much to Iceland's chagrin](https://youtu.be/1HU7ocv3S2o), due to the pandemic &mdash; and has grown in terms of number of countries participating, musical variety, visual flair and (some might say) fantastical preposterousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the name, the Eurovision Song Content is neither about Europe, nor Singing. According to the Eurovision website, the European Broadcasting Union which runs the contest is made up of \"56 countries and an additional 31 Associates in Asia, Africa, Australasia and the Americas\". The contest itself is billed as a *songwriting* competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [strict requirements](https://eurovision.tv/about/rules) that songs and performers must comply with. Songs must be original; under three minutes long; sung live without lip syncing and with no live plugging instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically the winning country is expected to host the technically challenging and costly event the following year (a 'prize' that [allegedly led to](https://www.irelandbeforeyoudie.com/why-ireland-stopped-winning-eurovision/) Ireland entering sub-par acts for at least a decade in a deliberate attempt to avoid winning). As many readers will no-doubt be aware, in 2022 the competition was won by Kalush Orchestra from Ukraine, with their song [Stefania](https://youtu.be/F1fl60ypdLs). This would ordinarily mean the 2023 event would have been held in Ukraine, however this was deemed unsafe in light of the Russian invasion. The UK (the 2022 runners-up) therefore stepped in, meaning that in 2023 the contest was held in Liverpool, 9–13 May.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seventy-year history of the event means there is now a large body of data about it to work with, as well as a large number of great songs to listen to. As you work through this Turing Data Story, we strongly recommend you listen to some of the great Eurovision masterpieces as your backing track, from the likes of [Celine Dion](https://youtu.be/w6b7BHGkKQA), [Bucks Fizz](https://youtu.be/h4-lKMGII_k), [Lordi](https://youtu.be/gAh9NRGNhUU), [Loreen](https://youtu.be/Pfo-8z86x80) and of course [Abba](https://youtu.be/Vp1_OKawHYw).\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current format, participating countries first take part in a semifinal; the top 10 from each semifinal qualify for the finals.\n",
    "The host country, as well as the \"Big Five\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK, which make greater financial contributions), directly qualify for the finals.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have pooled data from a number of different sources with the aim of understanding trends in the contest voting patterns. We have also tried to make the data as accessible as possible. The curated data frame is available in the `data/df_main.csv` file, and the code to create this dataset is in `data.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used this dataset to predict the winners of the [2023 event in Liverpool](https://eurovision.tv/event/liverpool-2023). Now that the event has taken place we've left this analysis as-is, so that you can compare our predictions with the actual results. But we've also now been able to add some post-match analysis to reflect on how our models did so that we can be even more accurate next year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll go into some detail about all of our data collection, analysis and results. If you're here for instant gratification and just want to know how we did, check out our summary on the [Turing Institute Blog](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/can-data-science-help-us-predict-winner-eurovision-2023).

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to explore the characteristics of Eurovision, with the aim of making predictions for the 2023 event, we first need to collect historical data about contests prior to 2023. We will obviously need to know what scores were assigned to which acts in previous years, but we also want to explore other factors that might potentially affect the success or otherwise of the performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has long [been claimed](https://www.datalytyx.com/eurovision-song-contest-regression-analysis-highlights-the-voting-patterns/) that there is a [measurable bias](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02664763.2014.909792) in relation to which countries vote for which other countries at Eurovision. We should therefore gather data that exhibits these biases. We also consider other factors that may affect voting patterns, such as the gender of the performer or language of the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Eurovision Song Contest has undergone several changes to its voting system since it began in 1956. These changes were made to increase transparency and reduce the impact of regional bloc voting, while still allowing for a fair and entertaining competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early years, the winning country was selected by a jury of experts from each participating country. In 1975, a new system was introduced that combined jury voting with telephone voting by viewers at home. Over time, the weight of the jury and viewer votes has shifted, with viewer votes becoming more influential. In 2016, the voting system was revised again, with separate scores given for jury and viewer votes, and a new system for calculating the final scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to model uniform voting scores over time, we limited our analysis to contests from 1998 onwards, where the jury and televoting scores are equally weighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections we'll describe our data-wrangling efforts in some depth. If you're more interested in the analysis, then you can safely skip forwards to the [Covariate visualisation section](#Covariate-visualisation) without losing the narrative."

    "## Voting Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Our voting data was pulled from the following sources: \n",
    "\n",
    "- From the [Eurovision Song Contest Scores Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datagraver/eurovision-song-contest-scores-19752019), for the years 1998–2019. \n",
    "- The 2020 contest was cancelled due to Covid. \n",
    "- The [2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2021#Final_2) and [2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2022#Final_2) contest scores were scraped from Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The jury votes have in the past been replaced with a substitute aggregate due to potential bias or 'irregularities'. In this case, new jury scores were calculated [\"based on the results of other countries with similar voting records\"](https://eurovision.tv/mediacentre/release/ebu-statement-voting-during-2022-shows). However, this is not very transparent and [not captured by our models](https://eurovisionworld.com/esc/here-is-the-proof-of-the-eurovision-voting-scandal-six-juries-cheated-and-voted-for-each-other).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in earlier years, since 2016 the jury and televoting scores have been reported separately. Simply summing these would lead to scores that are unusually large compared to previous years. In order to bring this in line, both votes were summed and rescaled by mapping the highest result to 12 points, second-highest to 10 points, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the data collection process the code is hidden for brevity, but available by opening out the sections in case you still want to view it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin we load in the Kaggle data which we host ourself to avoid having to negotiate with Kaggle's authentication wall."

Anecdotally there has been a tendency for songs to be sung in English if not a country's native language, and so we also keep track of whether a song includes English lyrics as well.\n",
