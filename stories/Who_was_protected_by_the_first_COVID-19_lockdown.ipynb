    "## COVID-19 and Deprivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone in the UK has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, from London to Manchester, Cardiff to Edinburgh. The virus has affected everyone, and taken many of the lives of people across Country.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the [23rd of March 2020](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52012432), the UK Government announced various lockdown measures with the intention of limiting the spread of the virus and reducing the number of COVID-19 related deaths. These lockdown measures meant the temporary closure of many commercial shops and businesses, as well as the limiting of work based travel to only those jobs that could not be done at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We are concerned that the impact of COVID-19 has disproportionately affected certain groups of people. In particular, that the lockdown may have had a worse impact on those in the most deprived areas, whose livelihoods may have required them to leave the house more frequently.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been a number of [concerns](https://www.ft.com/content/301c847c-a317-4950-a75b-8e66933d423a) with Government COVID-19 reporting, in particular with testing and mortality statistics. This motivates independent, open analysis to validate and expand on our understanding of our current state of the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in June, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) [published a report](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19bylocalareasanddeprivation/latest) exploring this exact question: to assess whether those living in the most deprived areas of the UK were disproportionately affected by COVID-19. The report seems to confirm our fear - between the months of March to May 2020 those in the most deprived areas of the UK were more than twice as likely to die as a result of COVID-19 than those in the least deprived areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two caveats that we have with the ONS analysis. The first is **reproducibility**. We want to confirm the ONS results by making the analysis procedure open. The second caveat is that the ONS report **aggregates data over time**, and therefore that it might miss interesting differences in outcomes between the different stages of lockdown. The lockdown was most severe between March and May, with measures relaxing from June onwards. We wonder whether the ONS analysis will continue to be relevant as lockdown eases. For this purpose, we wish to extend the ONS analysis to cover all available data, and at the same time, make a comparison between the different stages of lockdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus for our first story we ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Have the COVID-19 lockdown measures protected people equally across all socio-economic groups in society?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two main objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We want to replicate the ONS analysis using their provided data to ensure that we have all the inputs necessary to understand the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We want to extend the ONS analysis to consider different time periods - representing the severity of the different stages of lockdown - to see how this affects people from different socio-economic groups.\n"

    "Notice there are no Local Authority Districts that have a mean IMD decile of 1 or 10. This is due to the presence of variance inside each Local Authority District. For example, there is no single LAD whose constituent LSOAs all have a IMD deciles of 1 (or 10). See the table below for the maximum and minimum mean IMD deciles. Note that Blackpool, the most deprived (on average) LAD in England, has a mean IMD decile of 2.41. This demonstrates that this LAD has some LSOAs that are not in the most deprived deciles. The opposite is true for the least deprived areas. The \"Std IMD decile\" column in the below table shows the level of variation of the IMD (measured by the standard deviation) within each LAD."

    "## Derive Age Standardisation Weight\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for the different population sizes in the different Local Area Districts, we want to use a mortality rate rather than an overall count. When we do this we convert a count into a rate per 100,000 people. Furthermore, we want to account for differences in the age distributions of the different LADs in order to make a valid comparison between the different geographic areas. An age standardised rate allows for this comparison. Ideally we would calculate this rate directly from the data, but as our mortality over time dataset does not contain information about age, we instead will need to extract a standardisation factor from a different dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [dataset](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsinvolvingcovid19bylocalareaanddeprivation) we will use to do this comes from the ONS study on COVID-19 and deprivation. We will use it to derive a standardisation factor which will allow us to convert our mortality counts into an age and population standardise mortality rate. This mortality rate is a European standard (2013 ESP). As we mentioned, we cannot calculate the factor directly as our mortality over time dataset does not include age information, so this reverse engineering is the best we can do. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on how the mortality rate is calculated, [see here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017#death-rates-ratios-and-standardisation). Simply put, this is the formula that we are assuming approximates the relationship between the age standardised rate and the mortality count:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "age standardised mortality rate = [standardisation factor] * [mortality count]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ The above procedure is not ideal because it assumes that the distribution of ages of those who died inside each Local Area District is constant in time, and therefore the standardisation factor we derive in one dataset (which doesn't have information about time) can be applied to the other (which has information about time)."

    "- For all regions, the number of COVID-19 deaths is smaller than the number of non COVID-19 deaths.\n",
    "- The number of deaths varies a lot between different regions. This can be due to the fact that there are different numbers of people living in each region (for example, there are more people living in the South East than there are in the North East). On top of that, we know that older people have a higher risk of dying after contracting COVID-19, and as the age distributions are different for different regions, this can also affect the overall number of deaths."

Even with this caveat in mind, when looking at the chart we see it tells a very different story to the previous plot. For example, in the previous plot, the South East had the highest number of total deaths, but looking at the standardised rates in this plot we see that it is ranked second from the bottom. This shows that the raw mortality counts do not tell the whole story, and so we cannot rely solely on them to make meaningful comparisons between different Regions."

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We started writing this story in order to investigate whether COVID-19 deaths were related to social deprivation. We've also learnt a lot of other things along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, there is a very strong relationship between deprivation and general mortality. This means that deprived areas have a higher rate of mortality from all causes than less deprived areas. Life is more difficult if you live in deprivation. This effect is still observed when looking at COVID-19 specific morality rates, although is less strong than the trend from all causes. So COVID-19 appears to be less discriminatory across the different parts of society compared to other causes of death.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suspected at the beginning that the the state of lockdown may have different affects on different groups of people. We thus wanted to know if this relationship between COVID-19 and death rates changed during the different stages of lockdown. Our analysis shows that the relationship is stronger during the main lockdown period. Note that the relationship we see is only a correlation. More work would need to be done to give any answers about the causal processes that generate this correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many things that could be the cause of the observed correlation. Speculatively, it could be down to the fact that people from working class backgrounds are [less likely](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/economy/articles-reports/2020/05/13/most-middle-class-workers-are-working-home-full-ti) to be able to work from home made them more prone to contracting the virus during lockdown and take it home with them. This would explain their higher rates of mortality. But, as stated, more sophisticated data and analysis techniques would be needed to attempt answer the question of what is the cause of what.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment of writing we are entering a [second wave](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54212654). We hope that we will be able to learn from the challenges  that were faced earlier this year, and that more consideration and support is offered to people living in the most deprived areas of the country.\n",
