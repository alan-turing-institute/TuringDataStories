Our goal at _TuringDataStories_ is to produce educational data science content through the story telling medium. 

Our content will be split into different _Story Packages_, which begin with an interesting and relevant hypothesis and walks the user through the entire data science process - from gathering and cleaning the data, to using it for data analysis.

Our hope is that through these stories, readers will be motivated by the explanatory power of data science techniques, but also feel enabled to try it out themselves.

### About the project

This project was initially formed by a desire to contribute and advance to the analysis of government Covid-19 data.

As part of this process we recognised that government reporting of Covid-19 data was not always in the most accessible format. We also recognised that especially during these times, many invididuals may be interested in developing their technical skills in an impactful way, but not know where to start.

Our goal was therefore to help provide educational data science content that would guide the user through the process of making the data accessible, to using the data for analysis.

We hope that by using the story telling medium, we can bring people along the data science journey and showcase how these techniques can answer both fascinating and very much relevant societal questions. 

### What is a Turing Data Story?

The Turing Data Stories should be detailed and pedagogic jupyter notebooks that document an interesting insight or result using real 
world data. The aim of the Turing Data Stories is to spark curiosity and motivate more people to play with data. 

We expect that the notebook of a data story takes the reader through each step of the analysis
done to  create the data story results. You can have also scripts to make the jupyter notebook more light weight but we
expect each function to be properly documented and refered to in the story. The results should be fully reproducible and the notebooks
should be able to be ran by others using a determined computer environment.

If you have an idea of a Turing Data Story you want to develop please follow these guidelines to make sure your 
contributions can be easily integrated in the project. 

We hope that this guideline document will make it as easy as possible for you to get involved.
We welcome all contributions to this project via GitHub issues and pull requests.
